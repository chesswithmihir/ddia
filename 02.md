# Chapter 2 Data Models and Query Languages

## Introduction
Data models are the most 
Most apps are built by layering data models. Each layer answers the question, how is it represented in terms of the next lower layer? For example:

1. As an app developer, you look at the real world and model it in terms of objects or data structures, and APIs that manipulate those data structures. Those structures are often specific to your application.
2. When you want to store those data structures, you express them in terms of a general purpose data model such as a JSON or XML document or tables in a relational db or a graph model.
3. The engineers who built your database software decided on a way of representing that JSON/XML/relational/graph data in terms of bytes in memory, on disk, or on a network. The representation may allow the data to be queries, searched, manipulated, and processed in various ways.
4. On yet lower levels, hardware engineers have figured out how to represent bytes in terms of electrical currents, pulses of lights, magnetic fields and more.

In a complex application, there may be more intermediary levels such as APIs built upon APIs, but the basic idea is still the same: each layer hides the complexity of the layers below it by providing a clean data model. These abstractions allow different groups of people -- for example the engineers at the database vendor and the application dev using the db -- to work together effectively
