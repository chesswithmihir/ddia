# Chapter 2 Data Models and Query Languages

## Introduction

Data models = sys design architecture because it shows how we thought about the problem we are solving. Most apps are built by laying data models, one on top of the other. For each layer, the key question becomes: how is it represented in terms of the next lower layer? Let's go through an example

1. As an app developer, you look at the real world and model it in terms of objects or data structures, and APIs that manipulate those data structures. Those structures are often specific to your application.
2. When you want to store those data structures, you express them in terms of a general-purpose data model such as a JSON or XML document or tables in a relational db or a graph model.
3. The engineers who built your database software decided on a way of representing that JSON/XML/relational/graph data in terms of bytes in memory, on disk, or on a network. The representation may allow the data to be queries, searched, manipulated, and processed in various ways.
4. On yet lower levels, hardware engineers have figured out how to represent bytes in terms of electrical currents, pulses of lights, magnetic fields and more.

basic idea is always the same: each layer hides the complexity of the layers below it by provideing a clean data model. These abstractions allow different groups of people to work tgether effectively. The data model has a profound effect on what the software above it can and can't do so it's important to choose one that is appropriate to the application. In this chapter we will look at the range of general purpose data models for data storage and querying. the plan now is to disect the following:

1. relational model
2. document model
3. graph-based data models
4. query languages and compare their use cases

Then, in chapter 3, we will discuss how storage engines work and how these data models are actually implemented.

## Relational Model vs Document Model

The best-known data model today is SQL. data is organized into relations (tables) where each relation is an unordered collection of tuples (rows). the relational model was a theoretical proposal and many people at the time doubted whether it could be implemented efficiently. However by ~1985, RDBMs and SQL had become the tools of choice for most people who needed to store and query data with some kind of regular structure. The dominance of relatinal databases has lasted around 25 - 30 years -- an eternity in computing history.

The relational data model prevailed largely due to how it hid the implementation detail behind a cleaner interface where compared to other data models that required deep thinking behind the internal representation of the data in the database.

Over the years, there have been many competing approaches to data storage and querying. In the 1970s and early 1980s, the network model and hierarchical model were the main alternatives, but the relational model came to dominate them. XML databasess appeared in the early 2000s but have seen niche adoption. As computers became vastly more powerful they started being used for increasingly diverse purposes. And remarkably, relational databases turned out to generalize very well, beyond their original scope of business data procesing, to a broad variety of use cases.


## The birth of NoSQL

Now in 2010s NoSQL is the latest attempt to overthrow SQL :D

The name NoSQL is unfortunate since it doesn't;t actually refere to any particular technoilogy, it was intended simply as a catchy twitter hashtag for a meetup on open source, distributed, nonrelational DBs in 2009. But the term stuck a nerve and quickly spread through the web startup community and beyond. Now stands for Not Only SQL.

A couple reasons for why NoSQL was adopted:

- scalability (large datasets of high write throughput)
- free and open source software over commercial db products
- specialized query operations that are not well supported by the relational model
- frustration LOL (with restrictive schemas)

## The Object Relational Mismatch
Most app development today is done in OOP languages --> common criticism of SQL data model. If data is stored in relational tables, an awkard translation layer is required between the objects in the app code and the db model of tables, rows, columns. (impedance mismatch)

Object Relational Mapping (ORM) frameworks like ActiveRecord and Hibernate reduce the amount of boilerplate code required for this translational layer but they can't completely hide the differences between the two models.

## LinkedIn Profile Example

Figure 2-1 illustrates how a LinkedIn profile could be expressed in a relational schema. The profile as a whole can be identified by a user_id, first_name, last_name, etc. first_name and last_name happen exactly once per user but other fields like positions or educations can be more than one for each user. This is a one-to-many relationship from the user to these items which can be represented in various ways:

- traditional SQL model, the most common representation is to put positions, education, and contact info in seperate tables with a foreign key reference to the users table as in 2-1
- later version of SQL standard added support for structured datatypes and XML data, which allowed for multi-valued data to be stored within a single row. With support for querying and indexing inside those documents.
- Can also encode jobs, education and contact info as a JSON or XML document and store it on a text column in a db and let the appliucation interpret its structure and content. no bueno for querying tho.

```json
{
 "user_id": 251,
 "first_name": "Bill",
 "last_name": "Gates",
 "summary": "Co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates... Active blogger.",
 "region_id": "us:91",
 "industry_id": 131,
 "photo_url": "/p/7/000/253/05b/308dd6e.jpg",
 "positions": [
 {"job_title": "Co-chair", "organization": "Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation"},
 {"job_title": "Co-founder, Chairman", "organization": "Microsoft"}
 ],
 "education": [
 {"school_name": "Harvard University", "start": 1973, "end": 1975},
 {"school_name": "Lakeside School, Seattle", "start": null, "end": null}
 ],
 "contact_info": {
 "blog": "http://thegatesnotes.com",
 "twitter": "http://twitter.com/BillGates"
 }
}
```

For a data structure like a resume which is mostly a self contained document, a JSON representation can be quite appropriate. MongoDB supports this very well!
Some devs feel that JSON model reduces the impedance mismatch between the app code and storage layer, however as we shall see in Chapter 4, there are also problems with JSON as a data encoding format. The lack of a schema is often cited as an advantage for schema flexibility. It has better locality than the multi-table schema. If you want to fetch a profile in the relational model, you need to perform multiple queries under several tables and you might need to perform messy joins between the users table and subordinate tables. In the JSON table, 1 query is sufficient.
