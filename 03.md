# Chapter 3 Storage and Retrieval

## Introduction
DB = write/read. 
In chapter 2 we discussed data models and query languages (format in which you give db your daata and mechanism for asking for it back later).
Why should you as an app dev care how db handles storage and retrieval internally? you are prob not going to implement your own storage engine from scratch but you do need to select a storage engine that is appropriate for your app from many that are available. in order to tune a storage engine to perform well on your kind of workload, you need to have a rough idea of what the storage engine is doing under the hood. In particular, there is a big difference between storage engines that are optimized for transactional workloads and those that are optimized for analyitcs. We will explore the distinction later. But lets fist start by talking about two families of storage engines: log-structured storage engines and page oriented storage engines such as B-trees.

## Data Structures that power your database

consider the world's simplest db implemented in two bash functions:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
db_set () {
 echo "$1,$2" >> database
}
db_get () {
 grep "^$1," database | sed -e "s/^$1,//" | tail -n 1
}
```
