# Chapter 3 Storage and Retrieval

## Introduction
DB = write/read. 
In chapter 2 we discussed data models and query languages (format in which you give db your daata and mechanism for asking for it back later).
Why should you as an app dev care how db handles storage and retrieval internally? you are prob not going to implement your own storage engine from scratch but you do need to select a storage engine that is appropriate for your app from many that are available. in order to tune a storage engine to perform well on your kind of workload, you need to have a rough idea of what the storage engine is doing under the hood. In particular, there is a big difference between storage engines that are optimized for transactional workloads and those that are optimized for analyitcs. We will explore the distinction later. But lets fist start by talking about two families of storage engines: log-structured storage engines and page oriented storage engines such as B-trees.

## Data Structures that power your database

consider the world's simplest db implemented in two bash functions:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
db_set () {
 echo "$1,$2" >> database
}
db_get () {
 grep "^$1," database | sed -e "s/^$1,//" | tail -n 1
}
```

These 2 functions implement a key value store. You can call `db_set key value` which will store key and value in the db. the key and value can be (almost) anything you like -- for example, the value could be a JSON document. You can then call `db_get key` which looks up the most recent value associated with that particular key and returns it. 

awesome! we have a text file where each line contains the key value pair seperated by a comma kinda like a csv file. 

Performance on db_set is awesome O(1) as appending to the end of the file is quite efficient! Similar to db_set is the concept of using a log which is an append only data file. Real databases have more issues to deal with such as concurrency control, reclaiming disk space so that the log doesn't grow forever, and handling errors and partially written records. but the basic principle is the same. Logs are incredibly userful and we will encounter them several times in the rest of the book.

The word log is usually refered to app logs where an app outputs text that describes what's happening. In this book, log is used in the more general sense: an append-only sequence of records. It doesn't have to be human readable; it might be binary and intended only for other programs to read.

On the other hand, our db_get function has terrible performance if you have a large number of records in your db, its O(n). in order to efficiently find the value for a particular key in the db we need a different data structure (an index). In this chapter we will look at a range of indexing strcutreus and see how they compare. the general idea is to keep some additional metadata on the side which acts as a sign post and helps you locate the data you want. If you want to search the same data in several different ways you may need several different indexes on different parts of the data.

An index is an additional structure that is derived from the primary data. Many DBs allow you to add or remove indexes and this doesnt afftect the contents of the db. it only affects the performancce of queries. Maintaining additional structures incurs overhead especially on writes. for writes, it's hard to bea thte performance of simply appending to a file because that's the simplest possible write operation. now we have to also update the index.

indexes speed up reads but slow down writes which is a tradeoff. for this reason, DBs don't usually index everything by default, but require you the app dev or database administrator to choose indexes manually, using your knowledge of the app typical query patterns. You can then choose the indexes that give your app the greatest benefit, without introducting more overhead than necessary.
