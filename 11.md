# Chapter 11 Stream Processing

## Introduction 11.0

- Chapter 10 discusses batch processings
  - reading a set of files as input and producing a new set of output files (derived data)
-  Running the batch process again should yield the same derived dataset.
-  This can be used to create search indexes, recommendation systems, analytics, and more
- this assumes however, that the input is bounded (finite). Batch process knows when its finished reading input.
- It could be that the very last input record is the one with the lowest key so starting the output early is not an option when it comes to stream processing
