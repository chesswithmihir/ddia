> This book is awesome. It bridges the huge gap between distributed systems theory and practical engineering. I wish it had existed a decade ago, so I could have read it then and saved myself all the mistakes along the way. <br>
-Jay Kreps (Creator of Apache Kafka and CEO of Confluent, now BOD member for Anthropic)

> This book should be required reading for software engineers. DDIA is a rare resource that connects theory and practice to help developers make smart decisions as they design and implement data infrastructure and systems. <br>
-Kevin Scott (CTO of Microsoft)
